# In-Class Tests

In-Class Tests are provided for *summative assessment*. That is, they
won't affect your final mark but you should work on them to see how
you are getting on and to get feedback on your progress.

Despite the name, they are probably more work than you can complete in
a lab session -- you can work on them over several weeks in the labs
and at home.

See studentcentral for the submission dates if you want to receive feedback.
